Class exercise: matching individuals with similar interests

This site includes a survey which has 10 questions. The answers to those questions are compared to those in the database. The name and picture of the individual in the database whose questions best match the input questions are displayed.

This exercise uses Express to handle routing, and Heroku for hosting.
